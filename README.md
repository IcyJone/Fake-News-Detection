# Fake-News-Detection
This project implements a Fake News Detection system using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The model classifies news headlines as "Real" or "Fake" after preprocessing the text through tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization. The performance of the model is evaluated with an accuracy of 94%.
